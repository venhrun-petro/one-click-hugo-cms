    - paragraph: >-
        Redevelopment of buildings for innovative , trendy and community
        oriented office complexes that include added value services.
    - paragraph: >-
        Redevelopment or construction of buildings for “co-living” residential
        complexes that offer very little apartments for rent and innovative and
        interesting communal areas that include recreation , feeding and
        household services
    - paragraph: >-
        Kee-Boots comes from a skewed hebrew word “kibbutz” that means
        collective farm. Kibbutz in Israel is not only an agricultural village.
        It is a way of living with special values, that is now on the decline .
        We revive the spirit of collective working and living in a completely
        new way.

  title: About Us
philosofy:
  content: >-
    Our lives are changing rapidly. Different aspects of our life undergo
    profound change. For example the social media changed the way we interact
    with each other. Uber changes the transportation in the cities. Car sharing
    services make car owning an obsolete concept. And so on. Two clear
    tendencies can be spotted. Processes are that involve global networking
    survive.


    1. Processes are that involve global networking survive.

    2. Ownership of things gives way to “On Demand” services.


    Movies, music, news are more and more consumed as one time stream from the
    cloud rather than buying and storing it on your PC or as a hard copy. Also
    Bikes, Cars are more and more used via sharing services rather than by
    owning one. The real estate market also undergoes this change. We see the
    meteoric rise of office coworking space company “WeWork”. The concept
    involves buying membership in a global network of offices, rather than
    buying or renting specific office. The concept also involves global network
    of members that interact with each other. We also see the efforts to make a
    start up in the area of residential real estate. For example a “WeWork” spin
    off “We live”. Roam.co However a lot is yet to be done in this field. We
    propose to create a new philosophy of residential real estate approach that
    promotes and enables a new concept of life in accordance with latest
    tendencies. To adjust the actual Real Estate project we must first define
    the right lifestyle for a new generation of people. We will call this new
    lifestyle “New Exist” (NE).


    LIving in center of big city.


    1. Minimal ownership of objects. The NE person owns minimal amount of
    objects. A few jeans, a few T shirts, sneakers, a notebook and as smartphone
    is basically all he needs.

    2. The NE Person is creative and productive. He values his time.

    3. And tries to waste as little time as possible on “technical” household
    chores such as cleaning, cooking and washing clothes (unless he decides one
    of those things is a hobby).


    The housing solution should address those lifestyle principles.

plan:
  content: "We plan to build two types of coliving.\r\n\n\r\n\n1. KEEBOOTS Single. Focused on Single residents and childless couples.\r\n2. KEEBOOTS FAMILY Focused on couples with young kids.\r\n\nThe KEEBOOTS FAMILY house should have small private apartments with minimal storage space. Kitchen should be very small or not exist at all. Healthy food can and should be produced by professionals, at a specialised workshop. Cleaning should be done by professional stuff.\r\n\n\r\n\nA diverse communal areas should provide the ample space for work and leisure. It should be divided into relatively small areas, just a little bigger than a “living room“ in a conventional apartment. A person will choose which space feels more comfortable for him in a given moment.\r\n\n\r\n\nToday a few companies entered this market with a few very beautiful projects. However this is not even a tip of a iceberg of a huge market.\r\n\n\r\n\nAlso virtually all existing projects aim mainly at a young single professionals. Or at best at child free couples.\r\n\n\r\n\nA huge market exist for the same young professionals who either have a kid or two or are expecting one. It is the most challenging period in life and sometimes people make major changes in their life to accommodate to these new circumstances. Some buy a house in a suburb of a “commuter town” and start living a “standard family life”. Some rent a bigger apartment in a family friendly neighbourhood. It usually involves a drastic change in a lifestyle.\r\n\n\r\n\nSuch family will usually buy a whole bunch of possessions, such as furniture, toys, kitchenware and so on and will live and move with these objects for the rest of their life.\r\n\n\r\n\nWe believe that there is a huge demand for having kids while continuing to live a New Exist lifestyle. Without moving out of the center of the city, without buying a bunch of unnecessary stuff and without becoming a “housewife” who cooks and cleans the huge house all day long.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe solution is building a “Keeboots Family coliving” - an residential complex with tiny private apartments and big communal area that provide all the services a family with small kid might need. Some of the services are free and some cost money. A smart system of payment by “tokens” will be introduced.\r\n\n\r\n\n(Tokens as a local currency. not in a cryptocurrency meaning)\r\n\n\r\n\nA typical Keeboots family coliving will be an apartment complex with the ground flour as a communal area dedicated for the kids and adults attending the kids. And the upper floor as communal area for coworking and leisure without the kids. The floors in between hold the private apartments.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe Kids zone on the ground floor is a safe environment with one exit which is controlled by a guard.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe area consists of:\r\n\n\r\n\n1. Till midnight  Nursery for little babies (tokens).\r\n2. On site nursery for ages 6 month till 2 years (tokens).\r\n3. On site daycare. ages 3 till 5 (tokens).\r\n4. Yoga studio for kids and adults.\r\n5. Classrooms for special interest classes (tokens)).\r\n6. “Lego room” (free).\r\n7. Dolls room (free).\r\n8. Painting / drawing room (free).\r\n9. Outdoor playing ground with kids bicicles and kick scooters (free).\r\n10. Coworking area behind glass for mothers who want to work but watch their kids playing (tokens).\r\n11. Spa and gym\r\n\nThe upper floor\r\n\n\r\n\n1. Childfree coworking area\r\n2. Child free leisure zone: Smoking room. Movies room. Lounge area.\r\n3. Cafe and food catering service."
