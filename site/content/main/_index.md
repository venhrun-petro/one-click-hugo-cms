        property management in two main fields.
    - paragraph: >-
        Redevelopment of buildings for innovative , trendy and community
        oriented office complexes that include added value services.
    - paragraph: >-
        Redevelopment or construction of buildings for “co-living” residential
        complexes that offer very little apartments for rent and innovative and
        interesting communal areas that include recreation , feeding and
        household services
    - paragraph: >-
        Kee-Boots comes from a skewed hebrew word “kibbutz” that means
        collective farm. Kibbutz in Israel is not only an agricultural village.
        It is a way of living with special values, that is now on the decline .
        We revive the spirit of collective working and living in a completely
        new way.

  title: About Us
philosofy:
  content: >-
    Our lives are changing rapidly. Different aspects of our life undergo
    profound change. For example the social media changed the way we interact
    with each other. Uber changes the transportation in the cities. Car sharing
    services make car owning an obsolete concept. And so on. Two clear
    tendencies can be spotted. Processes are that involve global networking
    survive.


    1. Processes are that involve global networking survive.

    2. Ownership of things gives way to “On Demand” services.



    Movies, music, news are more and more consumed as one time stream from the
    cloud rather than buying and storing it on your PC or as a hard copy. Also
    Bikes, Cars are more and more used via sharing services rather than by
    owning one. The real estate market also undergoes this change. We see the
    meteoric rise of office coworking space company “WeWork”. The concept
    involves buying membership in a global network of offices, rather than
    buying or renting specific office. The concept also involves global network
    of members that interact with each other. We also see the efforts to make a
    start up in the area of residential real estate. For example a “WeWork” spin
    off “We live”. Roam.co However a lot is yet to be done in this field. We
    propose to create a new philosophy of residential real estate approach that
    promotes and enables a new concept of life in accordance with latest
    tendencies. To adjust the actual Real Estate project we must first define
    the right lifestyle for a new generation of people. We will call this new
    lifestyle “New Exist” (NE).

    LIving in center of big city.


    1. Minimal ownership of objects. The NE person owns minimal amount of
    objects. A few jeans, a few T shirts, sneakers, a notebook and as smartphone
    is basically all he needs.

    2. The NE Person is creative and productive. He values his time.

    3. And tries to waste as little time as possible on “technical” household
    chores such as cleaning, cooking and washing clothes (unless he decides one
    of those things is a hobby).



    The housing solution should address those lifestyle principles.
