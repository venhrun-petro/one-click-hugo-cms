        Redevelopment of buildings for innovative , trendy and community
        oriented office complexes that include added value services.
    - paragraph: >-
        Redevelopment or construction of buildings for “co-living” residential
        complexes that offer very little apartments for rent and innovative and
        interesting communal areas that include recreation , feeding and
        household services
    - paragraph: >-
        Kee-Boots comes from a skewed hebrew word “kibbutz” that means
        collective farm. Kibbutz in Israel is not only an agricultural village.
        It is a way of living with special values, that is now on the decline .
        We revive the spirit of collective working and living in a completely
        new way.
