        Kee-Boots comes from a skewed hebrew word “kibbutz” that means
        collective farm. Kibbutz in Israel is not only an agricultural village.
        It is a way of living with special values, that is now on the decline .
        We revive the spirit of collective working and living in a completely
        new way.
